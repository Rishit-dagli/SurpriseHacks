This repository demonstrates the process of training a model to identify from a plant leave between 38 diseases and also build a minimalistic web app to identify disease in plant 
leaves from images using the trained model. I use the [PlantVillage dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08060) by Hughes et al. consists of about 88,000 healthy and unhealthy leaf 
images divided into 38 categories by species and disease. Here I provide a subset of our experiments on working with this data.
